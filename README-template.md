## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap framework



### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I plan to continue to develop my skills using bootstrap as a framework for future projects while also learning to use custom css properties to style the project. Another area I will be focusing on in future projects will be media queries and how to use them in a css styling sheet. 


### Useful resources

- Stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me find the answers to the problems I was having with my code. I was able to search for various problems that I was having and found multiple suggestions on how to solve the problem, I found helpful solutions with explanations.
- Get Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - This is the boostrap website, I am currently still learning how to use this framework. This site is helpful when you are learning how to create respoinsive pages.
- MDN (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is a great resource when you need a reference sheet for anything code related. I refer to this site when I need a code refresher in any languge, I recommend this site to all developers.
